A bot that logs me into chrome and sets up github so I dont have to type in my credentials every time I use the university's computers 

TODO:
- [DONE] Add in a part of the script to auto configure github
- Add in a part to automatically clone my current working github repo
- Add in part that automatically opens spotify to The1975 or something
